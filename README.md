# Linear-Regression-Model
Implemented a Linear Regression class in Python using a numerical descent
algorithm from scratch to find the optimal parameters. Utilized the Mean
Squared Error (MSE) loss function to guide optimization. Showcases foundational
understanding of Machine Learning principles, numerical methods, and Object-
Oriented Programming (OOP).
